## 🗂️ Project Overview

This project covers the complete data science workflow:
- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Handling raw datasets and preparing them for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding the patterns in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Building:** Training and evaluating models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Results & Insights:** Interpreting the outcomes, visualizing important factors, and summarizing key findings.
