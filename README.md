# Movie Rating Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze movie ratings data to uncover insights and patterns. The project involves cleaning the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the factors influencing movie ratings.

## Step 1: Data Cleaning and EDA
- The first step of the project focused on data cleaning to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and free from errors or missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then conducted to identify trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.
- Visualizations and statistical summaries were used to gain initial insights and guide further analysis.
- EXAMPLE-
- What years had the best ratings?

-Do longer movies get better ratings?

-Who are the top directors/actors?

*More steps and analyses will be added as the project progresses.*
